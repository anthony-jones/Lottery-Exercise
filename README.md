# Lottery-Exercise
Your assignment is to complete the class LotteryRow, which is used to draw the week's winning numbers. The numbers are in range 1—40, and 7 numbers will be drawn in total. In other words, a lottery row consists of seven different numbers that are all in range 1—40.

We wish to implement the following functions in the class:

 - the constructor LotteryRow creates a new LotteryRow object that contains new randomized numbers.

 - the method numbers returns the drawn lottery numbers of this lottery row

 - the method containsNumber tells whether the given number is included in the drawn numbers

 - the method randomizeNumbers randomizes new numbers for the lottery row.
